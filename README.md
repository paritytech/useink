Dear contributors and users,

This repository and library is archived. We want to refer you to [`scio-labs/use-inkathon`](https://github.com/scio-labs/use-inkathon) for all your frontend smart contract interaction needs.

`useink` and `use-inkathon` emerged independently to address the same problem, even using similar tools. After discovering each other and engaging in discussions, it became evident that consolidating efforts into a single library, instead of two similar ones, would better benefit the ink! community.

The decision to transition from useink to `use-inkathon` was carefully considered, weighing factors such as codebase, userbase, and capabilities. We believe that `use-inkathon` provides a solid foundation for future development and want to foster and encourage ecosystem contributions.

To learn more about `use-inkathon` and itâ€™s fullstack dapp template inkathon make sure to join check out the repository: [`scio-labs/use-inkathon`](https://github.com/scio-labs/use-inkathon), the telegram group: https://t.me/inkathon and the website: https://inkathon.xyz/ .
